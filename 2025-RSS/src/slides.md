## YouTube Regrets

In 2019, Mozilla collected countless stories from people whose lives
were impacted by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. People had been
exposed to **misinformation**, developed **unhealthy body images**,
and became
trapped in **bizarre rabbit holes**. The more stories we read, the
more we
realized how central YouTube has become to the lives of so many
people — and just how much YouTube recommendations can impact their
wellbeing.

## How It Works – RSS Basics
### RSS is Just a Web Feed

1️⃣ Websites provide an **RSS feed**

```html
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Anarchy in the UK" href="example.com/feed.xml">
```

2️⃣ A **feed reader** (e.g., Feedly, Feedbro, Livemarks... ) periodically fetches updates

💻 **Example (RSS 2.0 XML):**

```xml {*}{maxHeight:'200px'}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>RSS Title</title>
    <description>This is an example of an RSS feed</description>
    <link>http://www.example.com/main.html</link>

    <pubDate>Sun, 6 Sep 2009 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
    <ttl>1800</ttl>

      <description>Here is some text containing an interesting description.</description>

## Time for history
yes, it's old, yes it's XML  
but it could have been worse...

<div class="flex gap-8">

::v-clicks

- **1999**: Netscape creates RSS 0.90  
  **RDF** **S**ite **S**ummary  
  RDF is ... pretty hardcore

- Also **1999**: RSS 0.91  
  **Rich** **S**ite **S**ummary  
  no more RDF, but still pretty hardcore

- **2000**: RSS 1.0  
  **RDF** **S**ite **S**ummary  
  RDF is back bitches!

- **2002**: RSS 2.0  
  **Really** **S**imple **S**yndication  
  XML FTW!

::

::v-clicks

- **2003-05**: Atom under IETF  
  **Atom**ic **S**yndication  
  still XML, just 'better'  
  Widely used, but never really replaced RSS

- **2017**: **JSON** **F**eed  
  JSON! But never really took off

### Google killed reader in 2013 🔫

>"Lack of interest"

or ... because they released google plus in 2011?

### Facebook and Twitter gradually dropped support 🔫

>"Declining popularity"

or ... because they wanted to keep you on their platform?

### Firefox removed live bookmarks in 2018 ⚰️

>"Focus on other things"
